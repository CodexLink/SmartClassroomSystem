# Requirements

In this section, we're going to talk in the software-side and hardware-side. This should be enough if you're willing to duplicate this project both physically and virtually. Keep in mind that this will be a bit hectic. So take a time if you're willing to do something about this project.

## Hardware-Side

This project is so expensive asf in the hardware stuff so that should be a spoiler alert for you . It took our allowance by 75% by the time we're buying the components. Especially CodexLink...

### Microcontroller

### Components

## Software-Side

# Deployment

In this section, we're going to talk about how to deploy this project. Unfortunately, we were able to deploy this project by Computer. We're supposed to deploy it in Raspberry Pi 4B but that didn't happened due to the pandemic.

`Coming Soon.`
